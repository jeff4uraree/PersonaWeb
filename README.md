# PersonaWeb

This is a project to create a web services for players of the game Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 Golden to allow users to specify the combination of personas they would like to try to fuse and get information about the outcome persona from the fusion.  The game does provide to you a search functionality to give all possible outcome personas you can get from fusing personas in your inventory, the interface to figure what outcome you get with a subset of personas you have in your inventory is quite cumbersome.  Hopefully this can provide a useful database for players to use to figure out their fusions.

# Features

* 2 Persona fusion (IN PROGRESS)
* 3 Persona fusion (BACKLOG)
